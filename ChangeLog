        * bwerp: left behind a bit of debugging code.

        * Thanks to Sven's eagle-eyed review, I've quoted the description
          content according to the RDF spec.  Added a few more nice-to-have
          elements, and some reasonable content for <link> and <dc:creator>.

        * Fixed a bit more code rot in programmatic/admin/news/wgo_news.py

2003-03-31  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@mysterious.org>

        * Fixed a redirection bug in

2003-03-22  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@mysterious.org>

        * Created admin/gimp-web-urls-subst which is gimp-web-urls
        modified for the new syntax.

        * Added new substitution programme, programmatic/tools/subst.py
        which handles arbitrary text files.  Two potentially significant
        effects of using the new substitution mechanism is the loss of the
        ability to insert a comment declaring the output is automatically
        generated, and run-time is increased due to context free
        substitutions and the flat substitution dictionary.

2003-03-22 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

        * style/old-default.css: This is the old default.css file.

        * /tutorials/Perlotine/*.html: Looked at the validation more.

2003-03-19  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@mysterious.org>

        * install.sh (log): Added a timestamp to the install log: make.out

        * Buffed up the top-level Makefile to declare .PHONY targets.  The
          _install target is now called install.

        * Fixed a bug in rewrite_attrs.py which caused URLs containing an
          octothorpe to be truncated and breaking rewrite_attrs.
        

2003-03-19 scizzo <scizzo@gimp.org>

          installation output to DocumentRoot/install.out

003-03-06  Carol Spears  <carol@gimp.org>

        * style/default.css: moved the font sizes up by 5% for the hn's :)

        * unix/howtos: removed all html and added htrw equivelents.

2003-03-05  Helvetix Victorinox  <helvetix@oak.mysterious.org>

        * Modified programmatic/contest/gallery.py to use the standard
          wgo.py preamble and head.

        * Top-level Makefile is now used from install.sh

        * Deleted unix/index.html since it is a generated file.

        * Moved unix/index-in.html to unix/index.htrw, the top-level
          Makefile knows how to translate a .htrw file into a .html file.

        * Updated the top-level Makefile with rules for building a .html
          file from a .htrw file

2003-03-04  Carol Spears  <carol@gimp.org>

        * Fiddled some in unix/:
                unix/index.html: created an index-in.html which will generate the
                    index.html using the /admin/gimp-web-url dictionary.  used the
                    new file to generate the old file.  also i changed the <div="*heading" />'s
                    to the logical <hn />.
                unix/howtos/bugzilla-in.html and bugzilla.html added bex how-to to the
                    list.  made it use the /admin/gimp-web-url dictionary for the urls.
                unix/howtos/cvs-stable.html this file has been removed, split up and 
                    replaced with:
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-get.html which is generated from 
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-get-in.html which i also added.
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-build.html which is generated from 
                unix/howtos/stable-cvs-build-in.html which i added.
                unix/howtos/template.html this file has been removed and replaced with:
                unix/howtos/howto-template.html which is generated from 
                unix/howtos/howto-template-in.html which i also added.
                style/default.css hopefully was fixed to reflect the addition of the <hn>'s.
                admin/gimp-web-urls is the dictionary for the attribute-rewriter
                unix/howtos/gimpenv added as promised in the build cvs gimp how to

        author.

        * /includes/wgo-xhtml-fini.xhtml: Helvetix helped me to add a
        validation link so that you only need to use this when validating. So

          new include files for tutorials, and includes my old tweaks to

          trying to click a button.  <input> elements are replaced with <a>
          elements of class "faux-button"

        * Contest images are now stored in /var/spool/wgo-contest/current
          instead of /contest/gallery

        not. might be nice to have an rc style for these things.  i
        decided to have different rc files for the different oses so that
        we have the option to add extra comments to each if necessary.

        i used man2html to convert the various gimp manpages to html.
